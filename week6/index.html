    <!-- Section 1: Concept Overview -->
    <section id="project-brief" class="section">
        <h2>Concept Overview</h2>
        <p>This project explores how the user interface of a car transforms once the vehicle becomes fully autonomous. 
        The interaction shifts from manual driving to system engagement — the vehicle evolves into a smart electronic device rather than a mechanical one. 
        Inspired by BMW’s interior design philosophy, the concept emphasizes <strong>digital minimalism</strong> and <strong>material contrast</strong>, merging advanced technology with tactile craftsmanship.</p>

    <!-- Section 2: Modeling Process -->
    <section id="modeling-process" class="section">
        <h2>Modeling Process and Design Choices</h2>
        <p>The design was built in Blender, starting with the dashboard as the central form. 
        The <strong>Subdivision Surface</strong> and <strong>Mirror Modifiers</strong> were applied to achieve smooth, symmetrical geometry. 
        The trim uses a <strong>wood material</strong> with <strong>aluminum wrapping</strong> along the edges to create a tactile, precise finish. 
        A separate <strong>climate control screen</strong> was introduced for dual-zone operation between the driver and co-driver. 
        The <strong>curved main display</strong> was modeled by cutting through a cylindrical mesh to generate a continuous, immersive viewing surface. 
        Lastly, the <strong>cup holder</strong> was carved using a Boolean subtraction with a cylinder, ensuring both functionality and design coherence.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Final Renders -->
    <section id="renders" class="section">
        <h2>Final Renders</h2>
        <p>The final renders highlight the complete dashboard composition, material contrast, and display integration. 
        The interface achieves a balance between <strong>comfort</strong> and <strong>technological precision</strong>, envisioning an interior where digital surfaces feel natural and inviting.</p>

    <!-- Section 4: Reflection -->
    <section id="reflection" class="section">
        <h2>Reflection and Next Steps</h2>
        <p>This project represents an early stage exploration of future in-car interaction design. 
        The next step focuses on redefining the <strong>co-driver’s role</strong> — developing shared interaction zones, adaptive ambient lighting, and contextual passenger information systems that extend the same design logic beyond the driver’s seat.</p>
