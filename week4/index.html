    <!-- Section 1: Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project recreates three iconic Soviet units and structures from <strong>Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2</strong> — the <strong>Rhino Tank</strong>, <strong>Sentry Gun</strong>, and <strong>Power Plant</strong> — in a low-poly style. 
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 2: Ideation and References -->
    <section id="ideation" class="section">
        <h2>Ideation and References</h2>
        <p>The main idea was to reinterpret the Soviet base aesthetics from Red Alert 2 in a minimal yet recognizable form. 
        The Rhino Tank reference was taken from a three-view image found online, while the Sentry Gun reference was generated using AI. 
        However, since the AI-generated image was not completely accurate, I adjusted proportions manually to match the Red Alert 2 visual style.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Modeling Process -->
    <section id="process" class="section">
        <h2>Modeling Process</h2>
        <p>All three models were built in Blender using a low-poly workflow emphasizing modifier efficiency and symmetry. 
        The <strong>Mirror Modifier</strong> was applied throughout to ensure perfect bilateral alignment, while the <strong>Solidify Modifier</strong> was used on the Rhino Tank’s cannon barrel to give it realistic thickness.</p>

        <h3>Reference Setup</h3>
        <p>I imported the three-view Rhino Tank reference image into Blender and aligned it in front, side, and top orthographic views. 
        For the Power Plant and Sentry Gun, I modeled primarily from perspective references, focusing on silhouette clarity rather than 1:1 accuracy.</p>

        <h3>Modeling Techniques</h3>
        <p>The modeling process involved blocking out basic shapes with cubes and cylinders, then refining details using edge loops and extrusions. 
        I focused on maintaining a clean topology to ensure the models remained low-poly while still capturing essential details.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
        This project was a rewarding exercise in low-poly modeling and stylized design. 
        It challenged me to distill complex designs into their most essential forms while retaining recognizability. 
        I learned a lot about using Blender's modifiers effectively and the importance of reference images in achieving accurate proportions. 
        Overall, I am pleased with how the models turned out and look forward to applying these techniques in future projects.
